# Strudel — Data as Music Track Author

## Overview

Strudel is a browser-based live-coding music environment (JavaScript port of TidalCycles). Data as Music (dam.fm) uses Strudel to sonify live prediction market data — turning price movements, trading activity, and market sentiment into music.

**Your job**: Write JavaScript track files that receive market data every 3 seconds and return Strudel code strings. The platform handles audio rendering, data delivery, and cycle-boundary alignment. Music is never interrupted mid-bar.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating new tracks from scratch ("write a house track that reacts to market data")
- Modifying existing tracks ("make the bass respond to volatility")
- Debugging tracks ("the melody cuts out when momentum is high")
- Explaining how data maps to musical parameters

## Track Architecture

Tracks live in `frontend/tracks/`. Each is an IIFE returning an object, registered via `audioEngine.registerTrack()`.

### Evaluate Mode (preferred)

The track returns a **Strudel code string** — the same code you'd paste into strudel.cc. The engine passes it to `evaluate()`.

For the full annotated template, see [examples/_template.js](examples/_template.js).

```javascript
// ── My Track ─────────────────────────────────────
// One-line description of the track's musical concept.
// category: 'music', label: 'My Track'

const myTrack = (() => {
  let _cachedCode = null;
  let _cachedKey = null;

  // Quantize helper (reduces pattern rebuilds)
  function q(v, step) { return Math.round(v / step) * step; }

  // Voice code generators — one function per voice
  function kickCode(energy, gainMul) {
    const g = (0.35 * energy * gainMul).toFixed(3);
    return `$: s("bd bd bd bd").gain(${g}).orbit(4);\n`;
  }

  function bassCode(tone, energy, gainMul) {
    const g = (0.30 * energy * gainMul).toFixed(3);
    const notes = tone === 1 ? "C2 E2 F2 G2" : "A1 C2 D2 E2";
    return `$: note("${notes}").s("sawtooth").lpf(400).gain(${g}).orbit(3);\n`;
  }

  return {
    name: "my_track",
    label: "My Track",
    category: "music",
    cpm: 30,  // MUST match setcpm() in evaluateCode

    // Voice declarations — mastering page renders per-voice gain sliders
    voices: {
      kick: { label: "Kick", default: 1.0 },
      bass: { label: "Bass", default: 1.0 },
    },

    // Runtime gain state (mastering page writes here)
    gains: {},

    // Returns current gain multiplier for a voice
    getGain(voice) {
      return this.gains[voice] ?? this.voices[voice]?.default ?? 1.0;
    },

    init() {
      _cachedCode = null;
      _cachedKey = null;
    },

    evaluateCode(data) {
      const h = q(data.heat || 0, 0.05);
      const tone = data.tone !== undefined ? data.tone : 1;

      // Include gain values in cache key so slider changes bust the cache
      const gainKey = Object.keys(this.voices)
        .map(v => this.getGain(v).toFixed(2)).join(':');
      const key = `${h}:${tone}:${gainKey}`;
      if (_cachedCode && _cachedKey === key) return _cachedCode;

      const energy = 0.4 + h * 0.6;
      let code = "setcpm(30);\n";
      code += kickCode(energy, this.getGain('kick'));
      code += bassCode(tone, energy, this.getGain('bass'));

      _cachedCode = code;
      _cachedKey = key;
      return code;
    },

    onEvent(type, msg, data) {
      if (type === "spike") {
        const gain = (0.04 + (msg.magnitude || 0.5) * 0.04).toFixed(3);
        return `$: s("<cr:0 ~ ~ ~>").gain(${gain}).room(0.4).orbit(5);`;
      }
      return null;
    },
  };
})();

audioEngine.registerTrack("my_track", myTrack);
```

### Pattern Mode (legacy)

Returns a Strudel Pattern object directly. Simpler but doesn't support `$:`, `setcpm()`, or `.orbit()`.

```javascript
pattern(data) {
  const h = data.heat || 0.3;
  return stack(
    note("<c2 c2 f2 g2>").sound("sawtooth").lpf(400).gain(0.3 + h * 0.2),
    sound("bd_fat").struct("x ~ x ~").gain(0.4),
  ).cpm(20);
},

onEvent(type, msg, data) {
  if (type === "spike") return sound("drum_cymbal_soft").gain(0.1).room(0.6);
  return null;
},
```

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Declare `cpm` on every track** and match it with `setcpm()` in evaluateCode. The engine uses this for cycle-boundary alignment.

2. **Never use `Math.random()`**. JS randomness produces different values on every 3-second rebuild. Use Strudel's cycle-deterministic randomness: `degradeBy()`, `rand.range()`, `sometimes()`, `perlin`.

3. **Use `<>` for progressions**, not JS counters. `note("<a2 a2 f2 g2>")` cycles deterministically based on Strudel's cycle clock — stable across rebuilds.

4. **Keep `$:` block count constant**. Strudel assigns positional IDs to anonymous `$:` patterns. If blocks are conditionally omitted, IDs shift and patterns mismatch. Emit every `$:` block always; use `$: silence;` as placeholder for inactive layers.

5. **Data drives parameters, not structure**. Pattern rhythms and note sequences should be Strudel mini-notation. Data values drive gain, filter cutoff, layer selection, intensity bands — never compute rhythms in JS.

6. **`struct()` defines subdivision**. A 16-element struct gives 16th notes natively. Do NOT add `.fast()` on top — that creates 64th notes.

7. **Multiply all `.gain()` values by `getGain('voiceName')`** for mastering page support. The mastering UI writes per-voice gain multipliers to `track.gains`. Every voice's gain must flow through `getGain()`.

8. **Declare `voices`** on every track. The mastering page reads this to render per-voice sliders. Use consistent IDs: `kick`, `snare`, `hihat`, `perc`, `bass`, `chords`, `melody`, `pad`, `fx`, `counter`.

9. **Include gain values in the cache key** so mastering slider changes bust the cache and rebuild the pattern immediately.

10. **Extract voice code into separate functions**. One function per voice, each receiving a `gainMul` parameter from `getGain()`. This keeps `evaluateCode()` readable and each voice testable in isolation.

## Design Principles

These are hard-won lessons from listening to tracks in production. Follow them closely.

### 1. Silence Is a Layer

This platform is an **alert system that uses music**. When the market is quiet, the music must be quiet — not just lower volume, but fewer layers, simpler patterns, near-silence. A listener should barely notice the track during low-activity periods, then be drawn in when something moves.

**The full dynamic range matters.** If `heat` is low and `trade_rate` is near zero, strip the track to almost nothing — maybe a faint pad or a single muted chord every few bars. Don't just turn gain down on a full arrangement; actually remove layers:

```javascript
// BAD: Everything plays, just quiet
const energy = 0.1 + h * 0.9;
code += bassLayer(energy);    // still playing at 0.1
code += drumLayer(energy);    // still playing at 0.1
code += melodyLayer(energy);  // still playing at 0.1

// GOOD: Layers peel away as activity drops
if (h < 0.15) {
  // Near-silent: just a ghost of the pad, everything else off
  code += '$: silence;\n';  // bass
  code += '$: silence;\n';  // drums
  code += '$: silence;\n';  // melody
  code += padLayer(0.05);   // barely audible
} else if (h < 0.35) {
  // Minimal: bass and pad only
  code += bassLayer(energy);
  code += '$: silence;\n';  // drums still off
  code += '$: silence;\n';  // melody still off
  code += padLayer(energy);
}
```

Design every track so that **consecutive low-activity rebuilds converge toward silence**, not toward a quiet-but-busy loop. The listener is waiting for news — don't exhaust their attention with sound that carries no information.

### 2. Melodies Must Not Be Repetitive

Tracks play for **hours**. A static 4-bar melody that ignores data becomes maddening within minutes. Every melodic element must either:

- **Be driven by data** so it changes as the market changes, or
- **Use Strudel's cycle-deterministic generative techniques** for built-in variation

**Techniques for melodic freshness (all cycle-deterministic, rebuild-safe):**

```javascript
// Rotate the starting note each cycle — 4 cycles before the pattern repeats
note("0 2 4 6").scale("C:minor").iter(4)

// Forward then backward — doubles effective length
note("0 2 4 6 7").scale("C:minor").palindrome()

// Random note choice per cycle (deterministic, not Math.random)
note("[c3|e3|g3|a3] [d3|f3|a3|b3]")

// Probabilistic ornamentation
note("0 2 4 6").scale("C:minor")
  .sometimes(x => x.add(note(7)))  // octave jump 50% of the time
  .rarely(x => x.add(note(2)))     // step up 25% of the time

// Layer a time-shifted variation on itself
note("0 2 4 6").scale("C:minor")
  .off(1/8, x => x.add(note(2)).gain(0.5))

// Every N cycles, apply a transformation
note("0 2 4 6").scale("C:minor")
  .every(3, x => x.rev())           // reverse every 3rd cycle
  .every(5, x => x.fast(2))         // double-time every 5th cycle

// Random dropout — different notes vanish each cycle
note("0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7").scale("C:minor").degradeBy(0.3)

// Weighted random sound selection per event
wchoose(["piano", 8], ["gm_vibraphone", 2])
```

**Combine these.** A melody that uses `.iter(4).sometimes(rev).degradeBy(0.2)` won't truly repeat for many cycles. The goal is a melody that feels composed but never quite the same twice.

**Map data to melodic parameters** — don't just use data for gain:
- `momentum` → melodic contour direction (see Design Principles §3 — Price Direction Must Be Audible)
- `volatility` → `.degradeBy()` amount (uncertain market = more fragmented melody)
- `price` → note range or octave (high price = brighter register)
- `trade_rate` → subdivision (`.fast()` or pattern density)

### 3. Price Direction Must Be Audible

This is a data sonification platform. A listener should be able to **tell by ear whether the market is going up or down**. This requires more than register shifts or major/minor mode — it requires **directional melodic contour**.

When momentum is positive, melodic phrases should literally move upward. When negative, downward. This applies to every pitched layer:

**Melody — pre-compose ascending and descending phrase shapes:**

```javascript
// Momentum selects phrase direction — the SHAPE of the line, not just a transposition
const momSign = mom >= 0 ? 1 : -1;

// Ascending phrases for uptrend
const melodyUp = "[0 2 4 6] [2 4 6 7] [4 6 7 9] [6 7 9 11]";
// Descending phrases for downtrend
const melodyDown = "[11 9 7 6] [9 7 6 4] [7 6 4 2] [6 4 2 0]";
// Neutral/flat for low momentum
const melodyFlat = "[0|2] ~ [4|6] ~ [7|4] ~ [2|0] ~";

const melodyPattern = Math.abs(mom) < 0.15 ? melodyFlat
  : momSign > 0 ? melodyUp : melodyDown;

note(melodyPattern).scale("C4:major")
```

**Bass — walking direction follows the market:**

```javascript
// Bass walks UP on uptrend, DOWN on downtrend
const bassUp   = "<[C2 D2 E2 F2] [A2 B2 C3 D3] [D2 E2 F2 G2] [G2 A2 B2 C3]>";
const bassDown = "<[C3 B2 A2 G2] [A2 G2 F2 E2] [D3 C3 B2 A2] [G2 F2 E2 D2]>";
const bassFlat = "<C2 A2 D2 G2>";  // static roots when sideways
```

**Chord root motion — ascending vs descending progressions:**

```javascript
// Bullish: roots move upward (C → D → E → F)
const chordsRising  = "<C^7 Dm9 Em7 F^7>";
// Bearish: roots move downward (C → Bb → Ab → G)
const chordsFalling = "<Cm7 Bbm7 Ab^7 Gm7>";
```

**Why this works:** Humans intuitively associate rising pitch with "up" and falling pitch with "down." A `.scaleTranspose(2)` shifts everything up but doesn't change the *shape* — the listener hears higher notes, not an upward *movement*. Directional contour is what creates the sensation of motion.

**Combine with `tone`:** Use `tone` (0/1) for major/minor quality and `momentum` sign for contour direction. These are independent dimensions:
- Bullish + uptrend = major ascending (bright, optimistic)
- Bullish + downtrend = major descending (easing off, still positive)
- Bearish + uptrend = minor ascending (recovering, hopeful tension)
- Bearish + downtrend = minor descending (things getting worse)

### 4. Every Layer Needs Dynamic Range

This is the most important principle for sounding musical. **Every instrument or group of instruments must have progressive stages of intensity that track the market continuously** — not just binary on/off at a heat threshold.

Gain alone is not enough. A four-on-the-floor kick at gain 0.05 is still a four-on-the-floor kick — it sounds like a full drum pattern turned down, not like a quiet market. True dynamic range means the **pattern itself changes**: fewer notes, simpler rhythms, sparser arrangement at low intensity, building up to full density at high intensity.

**The principle applies to every layer:**

#### Percussion (as a group)

Percussion should be designed as a unified group with stages. Each stage adds instruments and rhythmic complexity. The stages should be tied to the market metrics that represent rhythmic energy (`heat` for overall density, `trade_rate` + `velocity` for complexity).

```javascript
// BAD: Drums are either on or off
code += h > 0.3
  ? `$: s("bd bd bd bd").gain(${g});\n`
  : '$: silence;\n';

// GOOD: Progressive percussion stages
function percCode(h, intBand, energy, gainMul) {
  // Stage 1 (h > 0.15): Just a sparse kick — downbeat only
  // Stage 2 (h > 0.3):  Kick thickens (half-time), hats appear (quarters)
  // Stage 3 (h > 0.45): Full kick (four-on-floor), hats at 8ths, snare enters
  // Stage 4 (h > 0.65): Add fills, 16th hats, open hats, rim patterns
  // Gain ALSO scales with energy within each stage
}
```

Pre-compose the kick pattern for each stage:
```javascript
// Kick stages — pattern density tracks heat
const kickPattern =
  h < 0.30 ? "bd ~ ~ ~"           :  // downbeat only — minimal pulse
  h < 0.45 ? "bd ~ bd ~"          :  // half-time — building
  h < 0.65 ? "bd bd bd bd"        :  // four-on-the-floor — driving
             "bd bd bd bd"         ;  // same pattern, but add fills via .every()

// Hi-hat stages — subdivision tracks intBand/trade_rate
const hhPattern =
  intBand === 0 ? "hh ~ hh ~"     :  // quarter notes
  intBand === 1 ? "hh*8"          :  // 8th notes
                  "hh*16"          ;  // 16th notes with ghost notes
```

#### Melodic instruments (bass, chords, melody)

Same principle — pattern complexity should scale with the market:
```javascript
// Bass: from whole notes → walking quarters → busy eighths
const bassPattern =
  intBand === 0 ? "<C2 A2 D2 G2>"                          :  // one note per bar
  intBand === 1 ? "<[C2 ~ E2 ~] [A2 ~ C3 ~]>"             :  // half-time groove
                  "<[C2 D2 E2 F2] [A2 B2 C3 D3]>"          ;  // walking line

// Chords: from sustained pads → rhythmic stabs → busy comping
const chordStruct =
  intBand === 0 ? "x ~ ~ ~"                                :  // one hit per bar
  intBand === 1 ? "~ [~@2 x] ~ [~@2 x]"                   :  // offbeat stabs
                  "~ [~@2 x] [~ x] [~@2 x]"               ;  // busier comping
```

#### Why this matters for warmup

The server applies a smoothstep warmup tween that brings activity signals (heat, trade_rate, velocity, etc.) from 0 to real values over ~18 seconds. If your patterns respond to these signals with genuine dynamic range — sparse patterns at low values, building to full density at high — then the warmup automatically sounds like a natural intro: the track literally builds up from nothing. If your patterns are binary on/off, the warmup can only turn gain down, which sounds like a muted full arrangement rather than a true build.

**Design every layer so it sounds intentionally musical at every point in the 0→1 range**, not just at the top.

### 5. Percussion Must Have Life

Even genres that demand steady four-on-the-floor kicks need **micro-variation** in the supporting percussion. Perfectly uniform hi-hats sound mechanical and lifeless over long listening sessions.

**Techniques for percussive life:**

```javascript
// Velocity humanization with perlin noise (smooth, natural)
s("hh*8").gain(perlin.range(0.15, 0.35))

// Probabilistic ghost notes and accents
s("hh*16")
  .gain(perlin.range(0.1, 0.3))
  .sometimes(x => x.gain(0.5))     // random accents
  .rarely(x => x.ply(2))           // occasional flam/double

// Rotating emphasis pattern
s("hh*8").gain(".3 .15 .25 .15 .3 .15 .2 .15")
  .iter(4)                          // shifts accent each cycle

// Euclidean rhythms for organic feel
s("rim").struct("x(3,8)")           // 3 hits across 8 slots
s("cp").struct("x(5,12)")          // asymmetric, shifting

// Every N cycles, swap in a variation
s("hh*8").every(4, x => x.struct("x(5,8)"))
  .every(7, x => x.fast(2).degradeBy(0.4))

// Hi-hat open/closed interplay
stack(
  s("hh*8").gain(perlin.range(0.15, 0.3)),
  s("oh").struct("~ x ~ ~").degradeBy(0.3).gain(0.2)
)
```

**Map data to percussion character:**
- `trade_rate` → Euclidean density (`s("hh").struct("x(${pulses},16)")`)
- `velocity` → subdivision (8ths vs 16ths)
- `volatility` → `.degradeBy()` or probability of fills
- `heat` → number of active percussion layers AND pattern density (see §4)

## Data Signals

Every 3 seconds, `evaluateCode(data)` receives:

### Continuous Signals

| Signal | Range | Musical Role | Mapping Ideas |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `heat` | 0–1 | **Energy** | Volume, layer count, rhythmic density, arrangement fullness |
| `price` | 0–1 | **Harmonic position** | Register, note choice. 0.5 = max tension. 0.9+ = resolution. <0.2 = doom |
| `price_move` | -1–1 | **Phrase trigger** | Melodic runs, arpeggios, fills. Fires on 30s edge-detected movement AND slow drift (1.5¢+, graduated magnitude). Momentary gestures. |
| `momentum` | -1–1 | **Section mood** | Build energy on uptrend, pull back on downtrend. Sustained — works for section-level decisions. |
| `velocity` | 0–1 | **Pace** | Subdivision, tempo feel, rhythmic urgency. 5-min window, absolute: 10¢ move = 1.0 |
| `volatility` | 0–1 | **Tension/uncertainty** | Dissonance, detuning, filter wobble, tremolo, irregular rhythms |
| `trade_rate` | 0–1 | **Complexity** | Drum density, voice count, melodic ornamentation |
| `spread` | 0–1 | **Liquidity feel** | Wide intervals vs tight clusters, consonance vs dissonance |
| `tone` | 0 or 1 | **Key/mode** | 1 = bullish/major. 0 = bearish/minor. Has hysteresis — won't flicker. |

### The Four Market Moods

| Volatility | \|Momentum\| | State | Musical Character |
|-----------|------------|-------|-------------------|
| Low | Low | *Quiet* | Ambient, sparse, patient. Waiting for news. |
| Low | High | *Steady trend* | Smooth directional phrases. Walking bass, ascending lines. |
| High | Low | *Indecision* | Tension, dissonance, nervous energy. Rhythmic instability. |
| High | High | *Breakout* | Maximum drama with clear direction. The moment everyone watches. |

### Other Combinations

- **High heat + low price_move** = churning. Busy rhythms, static harmony.
- **price ≈ 0.5 + high volatility** = genuine uncertainty. Dissonant, unresolved, suspended chords.
- **price > 0.9 + low volatility** = decided. Resolution, consonance, finality.
- **Momentum sign flip** = trend reversal. Key change, section break, dramatic shift.

### Events

`onEvent(type, msg, data)` fires for one-shot moments. Return a code string (evaluate mode) or Pattern (pattern mode), or `null`.

| Event | msg fields | Musical Use |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `spike` | `magnitude: 0–1` | Crash, accent, dramatic hit. Scale intensity with magnitude. |
| `price_move` | `direction: 1\|-1`, `magnitude: 0–1` | Melodic run, arpeggio, fill. Direction = up/down. |
| `resolved` | `result: 1\|-1` | Finale. Market answered the question. 1 = Yes won, -1 = No won. |
| `whale` | `direction: 1\|-1`, `magnitude: 0–1`, `size: float` | Large trade (≥3x rolling median). Magnitude: 3x=0.33, 6x=0.67, 9x+=1.0. `size` is raw USDC amount. |

---

## Track Design Workflow

### 1. Understand the Request
- Genre/style (house, jazz, ambient, techno, etc.)
- Mood (dark, uplifting, tense, minimal, etc.)
- Which data signals to emphasize
- Complexity level (simple alert vs full arrangement)

### 2. Choose CPM
CPM = cycles per minute. For 4/4 time: `cpm = BPM / 4` (one cycle = one bar of 4 beats).
- Jazz trio at 120 BPM → `cpm: 30`
- House at 124 BPM → `cpm: 31`
- Ambient (slow) → `cpm: 10–15`

### 3. Map Data to Music
Design your signal routing before writing code. **Every layer must have a condition under which it falls silent** — there is no "always on":

| Layer | Active when | Driven by | Silent when |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Kick | `heat > 0.15` | `heat` (pattern density: sparse → half-time → four-on-floor), `heat` (gain) | Very low activity |
| Percussion | `heat > 0.25` | `heat` (which instruments active), `trade_rate` + `velocity` (intBand → subdivision/complexity) | Low activity — kick may pulse alone |
| Bass | `heat > 0.2` | `tone` (key), `heat` (gain), `intBand` (pattern density: whole notes → walking), `volatility` (LPF), **`momentum` (walking direction)** | Low activity — pad carries alone |
| Chords/Comp | `heat > 0.15` | `tone` (chord quality), `heat` (gain), `intBand` (sustained → rhythmic stabs), `volatility` (detuning), **`momentum` (root motion direction)** | Last to go, first to return |
| Melody | `\|momentum\| > 0.2` or `heat > 0.5` | **`momentum` (contour direction)**, `tone` (scale), `intBand` (density), `volatility` (fragmentation) | Must use generative techniques (see Design Principles §2) |
| Pad | `heat > 0.1` | `tone`, `heat` (gain), `volatility` (reverb/detuning), **`momentum` (voicing direction)** | Last layer standing |
| Texture | `volatility > 0.3` | `volatility` (gain), `spread` (filter) | Calm markets |
| Events | On trigger | `spike` (magnitude), `price_move` (direction + magnitude), `whale` (large trade) | Always conditional |

**The goal**: at minimum data values, only the faintest pad (or nothing) is audible. At maximum, every layer is active and rich.

### 4. Design Intensity Bands
Quantize activity into 2–3 bands using `trade_rate` and `velocity`:

```javascript
const rawIntensity = 0.6 * tradeRate + 0.4 * velocity;
const intBand = rawIntensity < 0.33 ? 0 : rawIntensity < 0.66 ? 1 : 2;
```

Pre-compose **complete patterns for each band** — don't just scale gain. Each band should sound like a deliberate arrangement choice:

- **Band 0 (low)**: Quarter-note hats, sparse kick (downbeat or half-time), no snare, whole-note bass, sustained chords
- **Band 1 (mid)**: 8th-note hats, full kick, snare enters, walking bass, offbeat chord stabs
- **Band 2 (high)**: 16th-note hats with ghost notes, fills, rim patterns, busy bass runs, active comping

**Combine intBand with heat for two-axis control:** `intBand` controls pattern complexity/density, `heat` controls which layers are active and their gain. This gives a wide dynamic range — from a single sparse kick at low heat/low intBand, to a full kit with fills at high heat/high intBand.

### 5. Write the Code
Structure every track the same way. Extract voice code into separate functions, pass `getGain()` multipliers:

```javascript
// Voice code generators (outside the return object)
function bassLayer(tone, intBand, energy, volQ, gainMul) {
  const g = (0.30 * energy * gainMul).toFixed(3);
  // ... return "$: ..." string
}

// Inside the track object:
evaluateCode(data) {
  // 1. Extract and quantize data values
  const h = q(data.heat || 0, 0.05);
  // ...

  // 2. Cache check — include gain values in key
  const gainKey = Object.keys(this.voices)
    .map(v => this.getGain(v).toFixed(2)).join(':');
  const key = `${h}:${tone}:${intBand}:${volQ}:${gainKey}`;
  if (_cachedCode && _cachedKey === key) return _cachedCode;

  // 3. Compute derived values
  const energy = 0.4 + h * 0.6;

  // 4. Build code string — layers peel away at low activity
  let code = "setcpm(30);\n";

  // Layers activate at different heat thresholds, gain flows through getGain()

### 6. Use `.orbit()` for Bus Isolation
Assign each layer family a separate orbit to prevent effect bleed:
- `orbit(1)` — harmonic instruments (piano, pads)
- `orbit(2)` — melody
- `orbit(3)` — bass
- `orbit(4)` — drums/percussion
- `orbit(5)` — event one-shots

## Available Sounds

### Sampled Instruments
| Sound | Usage | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `"piano"` | `.s("piano")` | Salamander Grand Piano, multi-velocity |
| `"gm_acoustic_bass"` | `.s("gm_acoustic_bass")` | GM upright bass |
| `"gm_epiano1"` | `.s("gm_epiano1")` | Rhodes electric piano |
| `"gm_vibraphone"` | `.s("gm_vibraphone").n(4)` | Vibraphone (use `.n(4)` for GeneralUserGS — see warning below) |
| `"gm_tenor_sax"` | `.s("gm_tenor_sax")` | Tenor saxophone |
| `"gm_*"` | `.s("gm_...")` | All 128 GM instruments (loaded on demand) |

> **GM Soundfont data quality warning**: The WebAudioFont data (from `surikov/webaudiofontdata`) has corrupt/tiny zones in some soundfont variants — notably the default vibraphone (`n=0`, JCLive) has a broken zone for MIDI 84-108 (C6+) with only ~225 bytes of sample data, causing `decodeAudioData` failures. The bundle includes logging and silent-buffer fallback for these cases. When using GM instruments in high registers, prefer the **GeneralUserGS** variant (`.n(4)`) which has valid data across all zones. Other instruments may have similar issues with specific variants — check the console for `[Soundfont]` warnings.

### Drums (uzu-drumkit + Dirt-Samples)
`bd` `sd` `hh` `oh` `cr` `rd` `rim` `cp` `cb` `ht` `mt` `lt`
Dirt-Samples variants: `bd:0`–`bd:23`, `sd:0`–`sd:11`, `cr:0`–`cr:5`, etc.

### Oscillators
`sine` `sawtooth` `triangle` `square` `pink` (noise)

## Example Tracks

### Track Template

See [examples/_template.js](examples/_template.js) — the annotated template for creating new tracks. Copy this file as your starting point. It documents:
- Full header comment format with data signal reference
- `q()` quantize helper
- Voice code generator pattern (one function per voice with `gainMul` parameter)
- `voices` declaration for mastering page sliders
- `gains` / `getGain()` mastering support
- Cache key construction including gain values
- `onEvent()` handler structure

### Poolside House

See [examples/poolside_house.js](examples/poolside_house.js) — a relaxed daytime house track at 116 BPM with full mastering support.

**What it demonstrates:**
- **Mastering support**: 7 voice declarations (kick, chords, bass, perc, melody, counter, pad), all gains flow through `getGain()`, gain values included in cache key
- **Extracted voice functions**: `kickCode()`, `chordsCode()`, `bassCode()`, `percCode()`, `melodyCode()`, `counterCode()`, `padCode()` — each receives a `gainMul` from `getGain()`
- **Directional contour** (Design Principles §3): melody phrases ascend/descend with momentum, bass walks up/down, chord root motion and pad voicings follow market direction. Sideways market gets meandering patterns with random choices.
- **Generative melody** (Design Principles §2): `.iter(4)`, `.palindrome()`, `.degradeBy()` driven by volatility, `|` random choice in note patterns, `.rarely(add(note(7)))` for octave sparkle
- **Living percussion** (Design Principles §5): perlin-humanized hi-hat velocity, `.sometimes()` accents, `.rarely(ply(2))` flams, `.iter()` rotating emphasis, `.every(4, struct("x(5,8)"))` euclidean variation
- **Layer stripping** (Design Principles §1): pad (>0.1) → rhodes (>0.15) → bass (>0.25) → drums (>0.3) → melody (momentum-driven) → counter-melody (>0.6). At heat=0, all blocks emit silence.
- Rhodes with offbeat stabs, jazz voicings, 3-tier percussion, bouncy walking bass

**Known areas for improvement:**
- **Percussion lacks dynamic range** (Design Principles §4): kick is binary (off below heat 0.3, full four-on-the-floor above). Needs progressive stages (sparse → half-time → full → fills). Same for hats, snare, and supporting percussion. All percussion instruments should build up continuously with the market, not switch on at full density.
- Could benefit from a texture/atmosphere layer (filtered noise, nature-like ambience) at mid-heat
- Counter-melody could use a different timbre (vibraphone?) to differentiate from main melody

Study this track for structure and architecture. It implements all four Design Principles and the mastering format.
