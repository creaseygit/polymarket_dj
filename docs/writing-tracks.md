# Writing Tracks

Tracks are JavaScript files in `frontend/tracks/` that use Strudel (`@strudel/web` + `@strudel/soundfonts`) to generate audio in the browser. Each track is an object that receives market data and produces audio via one of two modes.

## Track Modes

### Evaluate mode (preferred for faithful strudel.cc reproduction)

The track provides an `evaluateCode(data)` method that returns a strudel code **string**. The audio engine passes it to strudel's `evaluate()` function — the same code path strudel.cc's REPL uses. This handles `$:` pattern labels, `setcpm()`, `.orbit()` isolation, and the transpiler identically.

```javascript
const myTrack = {
  name: "my_track",
  label: "My Track",
  category: "music",
  cpm: 30,  // cycles per minute — must match setcpm() in evaluateCode

  init() {},

  evaluateCode(data) {
    // Return raw strudel code — identical to what you paste into strudel.cc.
    // Use string interpolation to inject data values.
    return `
      setcpm(30);
      $: note("c4 e4 g4").s("piano").gain(${0.2 + (data.heat || 0.3) * 0.3})
      $: s("bd sd bd sd").gain(0.3).orbit(1)
    `;
  },

  onEvent(type, msg, data) {
    // Return a code string for evaluate-mode tracks, or null
    if (type === "spike") {
      const gain = (0.04 + (msg.magnitude || 0.5) * 0.04).toFixed(3);
      return `$: s("<cr:0 ~ ~ ~>").gain(${gain}).room(0.4).orbit(5);`;
    }
    return null;
  },
};

audioEngine.registerTrack("my_track", myTrack);
```

### Pattern mode (legacy)

The track provides a `pattern(data)` method that returns a Strudel Pattern object directly. Simpler but doesn't support `$:`, `setcpm()`, or `.orbit()` — patterns must be combined with `stack().cpm()`.

```javascript
const myTrack = {
  name: "my_track",
  label: "My Track",
  category: "music",
  cpm: 20,  // cycles per minute — must match .cpm() in pattern

  init() {},

  pattern(data) {
    const h = data.heat || 0.3;
    return stack(
      note("<c2 c2 f2 g2>").sound("sawtooth").lpf(400).gain(0.3 + h * 0.2),
      sound("bd_fat").struct("x ~ x ~").gain(0.4),
    ).cpm(20);
  },

  onEvent(type, msg, data) {
    if (type === "spike") return sound("drum_cymbal_soft").gain(0.1).room(0.6);
    return null;
  },
};

audioEngine.registerTrack("my_track", myTrack);
```

**Key principle: patterns are regenerated, not mutated.** Both modes are called fresh every 3 seconds with new data.

**Key principle: music is never interrupted mid-bar.** The audio engine buffers incoming data and defers pattern rebuilds to the next **cycle boundary** (downbeat). Tracks must declare their `cpm` so the engine can calculate timing.

**Critical rules for stable, musical output:**

1. **Declare `cpm` on every track.** The audio engine uses this to calculate cycle boundaries for data buffering. Without `cpm`, updates apply immediately (no boundary alignment).

2. **Never use `Math.random()`** in `pattern()`. JS randomness produces different values on each 3-second rebuild, making the music chaotic. Use Strudel's cycle-deterministic randomness instead: `degradeBy()`, `rand.range()`, `sometimes()`.

3. **Use `<>` mini-notation for progressions**, not JS counters. `note("<a2 a2 f2 g2>")` cycles one value per bar based on the Strudel cycle position — stable across rebuilds.

4. **`struct()` already defines subdivision.** A 16-element struct gives 16th notes natively. Do NOT add `fast()` on top of struct patterns — that creates 64th notes.

5. **Use data values only for parameters** (gain, filter cutoff) and structural decisions (which layers to include). The pattern *structure* (rhythms, note sequences) should be Strudel mini-notation, not JS-computed.

6. **Keep the `$:` block count constant** (evaluate-mode tracks). Strudel assigns positional IDs to anonymous `$:` patterns. If blocks are conditionally omitted, IDs shift and patterns get mismatched on transitions. Instead, always emit every `$:` block and use `$: silence;` as a placeholder when a layer is inactive.

## Data Received

The `pattern(data)` or `evaluateCode(data)` method receives these values every 3 seconds:

```javascript
{
  // ── What's happening ──
  heat: 0.0-1.0,         // Overall market activity (energy)
  trade_rate: 0.0-1.0,   // How frequently people are trading
  spread: 0.0-1.0,       // Order book tightness

  // ── Price & direction ──
  price: 0.0-1.0,        // Current market price (0=No, 1=Yes)
  price_move: -1.0-1.0,  // "Is price moving RIGHT NOW?" — only non-zero during active moves (30s window)
  momentum: -1.0-1.0,    // "What's the trend?" — positive=uptrend, negative=downtrend (sensitivity-scaled window)
  velocity: 0.0-1.0,     // Speed of price change (unsigned)

  // ── Character ──
  volatility: 0.0-1.0,   // Market uncertainty — high=erratic bouncing, low=calm
  tone: 0|1,             // 1=bullish/major, 0=bearish/minor (with hysteresis, won't flicker)
  sensitivity: 0.0-1.0,  // User's sensitivity slider value (optional use)
}
```

### How to think about these signals musically

| Signal | Musical role | Example mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `heat` | **Energy** — how loud/busy should things be? | Volume scaling, layer count, rhythmic density |
| `price` | **Harmonic position** — where are we? | Register, note choice, tension/resolution (0.5=uncertain, 0.9+=resolved) |
| `price_move` | **Phrase trigger** — something is happening NOW | Ascending/descending melodic runs, arpeggios, fills |
| `momentum` | **Section mood** — sustained direction | Build energy during uptrend, pull back during downtrend, sparse when sideways |
| `velocity` | **Pace** — how fast is the market moving? | Tempo feel, rhythmic subdivision |
| `volatility` | **Tension/uncertainty** — erratic vs calm | Dissonance, detuning, filter modulation, tremolo, irregular rhythms |
| `trade_rate` | **Complexity** — how much activity? | Drum pattern complexity, number of instruments, melodic density |
| `spread` | **Liquidity feel** — tight book vs wide gap | Consonance/dissonance, register width |
| `tone` | **Key/mode** — major or minor? | Scale selection, chord quality |

### Signal combinations worth listening for

- **High volatility + low |momentum|** = *indecision* — market is bouncing with no direction. Map to: tension, dissonance, unsettled rhythms.
- **High volatility + high |momentum|** = *breakout* — volatile but going somewhere. Map to: dramatic energy + directional phrases.
- **Low volatility + high |momentum|** = *steady trend* — calm, confident move. Map to: smooth ascending/descending lines.
- **Low volatility + low |momentum|** = *quiet* — nothing happening. Map to: ambient, sparse, waiting.

### Sensitivity

The user's **sensitivity slider** controls how reactive the music is. You don't need to handle this — it's pre-applied before your track receives data:

- **Activity signals** (`heat`, `velocity`, `trade_rate`, `spread`, `price_move`): amplitude is scaled — high sensitivity inflates small values, low sensitivity crushes them.
- **Trend signals** (`momentum`, `volatility`): the analysis **window length** changes — high sensitivity = short window (reactive, catches quick moves), low sensitivity = long window (smooth, only sustained trends). This is like switching between short and long moving averages on a trading chart.

## Events

The `onEvent(type, msg, data)` method handles one-shot events. Return type depends on track mode:
- **Evaluate-mode tracks**: return a code string (appended to base `evaluateCode()` output), or `null`
- **Pattern-mode tracks**: return a Pattern object (stacked with base `pattern()` output), or `null`

| Event | `msg` fields | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spike` | `magnitude: 0.0–1.0` | Heat spike — magnitude tells you how big (small threshold breach vs huge jump) |
| `price_move` | `direction: 1\|-1`, `magnitude: 0.0–1.0` | Significant price change — direction + size |
| `resolved` | `result: 1\|-1` | Market resolved (1=Yes won, -1=No won) |

Use `msg.magnitude` to scale your response — a tiny spike and a massive spike can sound different:

```javascript
// Evaluate-mode example:
onEvent(type, msg, data) {
  if (type === "spike") {
    const gain = (0.04 + (msg.magnitude || 0.5) * 0.04).toFixed(3);
    return `$: s("<cr:0 ~ ~ ~>").gain(${gain}).room(0.4).orbit(4);`;
  }
  return null;
}

// Pattern-mode example:
onEvent(type, msg, data) {
  if (type === "spike") {
    const gain = 0.04 + (msg.magnitude || 0.5) * 0.04;
    return sound("cr:0").gain(gain).room(0.4);
  }
  return null;
}
```

## Track Metadata

Add metadata as comments at the top of the file for the server to parse:
```javascript
// category: 'music', label: 'My Track Name'
```

## Adding a New Track

Tracks are **auto-discovered and dynamically loaded** — no `index.html` changes needed:
1. Copy `frontend/tracks/_template.js` to `frontend/tracks/yourname.js`
2. Rename the track, fill in voices and patterns (the template is fully annotated)
3. Restart the server (it scans `frontend/tracks/` on startup)
4. The browser loads track scripts dynamically based on the server's discovered list

## Voice Gain System (Mastering Support)

All music tracks must declare a `voices` object for per-voice gain control from the mastering page. See `frontend/tracks/_template.js` for the full annotated pattern, or [`docs/development/mastering-and-sandbox.md`](development/mastering-and-sandbox.md) for the design spec.

```javascript
voices: {
  kick:   { label: "Kick",   default: 1.0 },
  bass:   { label: "Bass",   default: 1.0 },
  chords: { label: "Chords", default: 1.0 },
  melody: { label: "Melody", default: 1.0 },
},
gains: {},
getGain(voice) {
  return this.gains[voice] ?? this.voices[voice]?.default ?? 1.0;
},
```

In each voice code generator, multiply `.gain()` values by `this.getGain('voiceName')`:
```javascript
const g = (0.35 * energy * this.getGain('kick')).toFixed(3);
```

Use consistent voice IDs across tracks: `kick`, `snare`, `hihat`, `perc`, `bass`, `chords`, `melody`, `pad`, `fx`.

## Music Utilities

`audio-engine.js` provides helpers (independent of Strudel):
- `getScaleNotes(root, scaleType, count, octaves)` — Get scale notes
- `midiToNote(midi)` / `noteToMidi(note)` — Convert between MIDI numbers and note names (`C#4`, `Bb3`)
- `noteToStrudel(noteName)` — Convert standard notation to Strudel format (`C#4` → `cs4`, `Bb3` → `bb3`)
- `SCALES` — `{major, minor}` interval arrays

## Sounds

Tracks use Strudel's built-in oscillators, sampled instruments, and multiple loaded sample libraries:

1. **Salamander Grand Piano** (`"piano"`) — Multi-velocity acoustic grand piano from CDN
2. **Dirt-Samples** — 200+ sample banks from TidalCycles (drums, cymbals, percussion)
3. **uzu-drumkit** — Default drum sounds: `bd`, `sd`, `hh`, `oh`, `cr`, `rd` (ride), `rim` (rimshot), `cp`, `cb`, `ht`, `mt`, `lt`
4. **VCSL** — Orchestral percussion (CC0 license)
5. **Tidal Drum Machines** — Classic drum machine samples (TR-808, LinnDrum, etc.)
6. **GM Soundfonts** (`"gm_*"`) — 128 General MIDI instruments via `@strudel/soundfonts` (loaded from webaudiofontdata CDN on demand)

```javascript
note("c4 e4 g4").sound("piano").gain(0.3).room(0.5)        // acoustic piano
note("c2 e2 a2").sound("gm_acoustic_bass").gain(0.3)       // GM upright bass
note("<c2 f2>").sound("sawtooth").lpf(200).gain(0.1)        // synth oscillator
sound("rd").gain(0.25)                                       // ride cymbal (uzu-drumkit)
sound("cr:0").speed(0.95).gain(0.06).end(0.3)               // crash cymbal (Dirt-Samples)
```

## Strudel Pattern Basics

Common patterns used in existing tracks:

```javascript
// ── Basic patterns ──
note("c3 e3 g3").sound("sine").gain(0.2)       // synth notes
sound("bd_fat").speed(0.85).lpf(370).gain(0.3)  // sample trigger
note("c4 e4 g4").sound("piano").room(0.3)        // sampled piano

// ── Stack layers ──
stack(
  sound("bd_fat").struct("x ~ x ~").gain(0.4),
  sound("sn_dub").struct("~ x ~ ~").gain(0.15),
  note("c3 e3 g3").sound("sine").gain(0.2)
).cpm(20)  // 80 BPM (= 20 cycles per minute)

// ── Cycling / Progressions ──
note("<a2 a2 f2 g2>").sound("sine")   // <> = one per cycle (chord roots)
note("[c3 e3 g3 e3]").sound("sine")   // [] = all in one cycle (arp)

// ── Rhythms ──
sound("bd_fat").struct("x ~ x ~")      // 4 positions = quarter notes
sound("sn_dub").struct("~ x ~ ~")      // snare on beat 2
sound("drum_cowbell").struct("~ ~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~ ~ x ~ ~ x ~ ~")  // 16th notes
// WARNING: struct element count = subdivision. Do NOT add fast() on top.

// ── Duration weights ──
note("[a2@3 ~ e3 d3 a2@2]")  // a2=3/8, rest=1/8, e3=1/8, d3=1/8, a2=2/8

// ── Speed / Slow ──
sound("vinyl_hiss").slow(2)   // every 2 cycles
sound("hh").fast(4)           // 4× speed (for simple patterns WITHOUT struct)

// ── Probabilistic (cycle-deterministic, safe for rebuilds) ──
sound("hh").degradeBy(0.6)               // 40% chance of playing
sound("hh").gain(rand.range(0.05, 0.15)) // random gain per event
sound("hh").speed(rand.range(1.2, 1.8))  // random speed per event

// ── Rests ──
note("c3 ~ e3 ~ g3").sound("sine")  // ~ = silence

// ── Pan with LFO ──
.pan(sine.range(0.3, 0.7).slow(4))
```

## Existing Tracks

### oracle.js
Piano chord alert that fires on price moves. Uses `price_move` (edge-detected, only non-zero during active movement): magnitude sets chord count (2-5), sign sets direction (ascending=up, descending=down). Silent when price is flat. C major when bullish (tone=1), A minor when bearish (tone=0). Uses pre-defined triad chord runs via polyphonic mini-notation `[deg,deg+2,deg+4]`. **Momentum** shifts chord register up/down (uptrend = higher voicings, downtrend = lower, ±3 semitones). **Volatility** controls reverb depth (uncertainty = more spacey, ethereal). Responds to `spike` events with crash cymbal scaled by magnitude.

### late_night_in_bb.js
Jazz piano trio with two market paradigms, 120 BPM. **Uses evaluate mode** — strudel code built dynamically with data-driven interpolation. **8 voices:** `bass`, `melody`, `ride`, `hihat`, `comp`, `ghostSnare`, `crossStick`, `kick`, `fill` — all with mastering gain support via `getGain()`. **Two paradigms driven by `tone`:** Bullish (tone=1) plays Bb major changes (Cm7→F7→BbΔ7→EbΔ7, ii-V-I-IV) with ascending bass walks and ascending melodies. Bearish (tone=0) plays G minor changes (Am7b5→D7→Gm7→Cm7, iiø-V-i-iv) with descending bass walks and descending melodies. **Intensity axis:** `trade_rate` (60%) + `velocity` (40%) compute an intensity score quantized into 3 bands (low/mid/high). Each band selects from pre-composed bass (16 bars x 6 variants), melody (8 bars x 6 variants), and percussion patterns of increasing complexity. Low: quarter-note walks, sparse comping, simple hi-hat. Mid: eighth-note approaches, ghost snares, cross-stick. High: chromatic runs, kick bombs, turnaround fills, dense comping. Heat still controls overall energy/gain scaling. **Momentum** sustains melody during trends — melody plays when `price_move` is active OR `|momentum| > 0.1`, so sustained trends keep the melody alive even after the edge-detected move decays. **Volatility** drives timbral uncertainty: piano comping gets slight detuning (`.speed(rand.range(...))`), delay feedback increases (more wash/echo), and bass LPF drops (darker, muddier tone). All layers use `.orbit()` for bus isolation. Spike events trigger crash cymbal scaled by event magnitude.

### poolside_house.js
Relaxed daytime house driven by market data, ~116 BPM (cpm 29). **Uses evaluate mode.** **7 voices:** `kick`, `chords`, `bass`, `perc`, `melody`, `counter`, `pad` — all with mastering gain support. **Layered activation by heat:** pad appears at heat 0.1, chords at 0.15, bass at 0.25, kick+percussion at 0.3, melody at 0.5 or |momentum| > 0.2, counter-melody at 0.6. At rest (heat=0), the track is completely silent. **Harmonic system:** bullish = C major changes (CΔ7→Am9→Dm9→G7), bearish = A minor (Am7→Fm9→Dm7→E7). Rhodes/EP chords use iReal voicings. **Intensity bands** (same formula as late_night_in_bb) control percussion density: band 0 = humanized shaker, band 1 = hats + claps + open hat, band 2 = dense 16th hats + euclidean rim + doubled claps. **Generative melody:** uses `iter()`, `palindrome()`, `degradeBy()`, `every(3, rev)` for non-repetitive lines. **Momentum** shifts melody register via `scaleTranspose()` and chords via `transpose()`. **Volatility** drives reverb depth, pattern degradation (fragmentation), and delay feedback. **Price** controls global filter (higher price = brighter). Spike events trigger open hat, price_move events trigger scale runs (ascending=up, descending=down), resolved events play sustained EP chord.

### diagnostic.js
System test track for audible data verification. **Not musical — diagnostic.** One dedicated sound per signal, spatially separated via pan and orbit so they don't mask each other. Toggle individual layers on/off via the `LAYERS` config object at the top of the file. Close your eyes and identify each signal by ear:

| Signal | Sound | Pan | What to listen for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `heat` | Kick drum pulse | Center | Rate: 1 hit/cycle at 0 → 8 hits at 1 |
| `price` | Sine drone | Center | Pitch: C3 at price=0 → C5 at price=1 |
| `momentum` | Sawtooth + filter sweep | Left | Pitch rises with +ve momentum, drops with -ve. Filter sweeps up/down to reinforce direction |
| `volatility` | Pink noise | Right | Narrow quiet hiss when calm → wide loud wash when volatile |
| `price_move` | Piano arpeggio | Left | Ascending run = up, descending = down. More notes = bigger move |
| `trade_rate` | Hi-hat | Right | 2 hits at 0 → 8 hits at 1, evenly spread |
| `tone` | Triangle pad chord | Center | C major (tone=1) or A minor (tone=0) |
| `spread` | Cowbell tick | Right | Filter opens with spread (muffled=tight, bright=wide) |
| `spike` event | Crash cymbal | Center | Gain scales with event magnitude |
| `price_move` event | Vibraphone bell | Center | High pitch = up, low = down. Gain scales with magnitude |
