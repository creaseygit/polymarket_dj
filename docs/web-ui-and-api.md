# Web UI & API

## Main Page (localhost:8888)

The UI has four sections:

1. **Audio** — Start/Stop, track selector, volume slider, sensitivity slider (0–100%, controls how reactive music is to market changes), test sounds, Kill All, link to Track Sandbox
2. **Now Playing** — Current market question, bullish/bearish + price %, raw data values (heat, velocity, trade rate, spread), link to Polymarket
3. **Feed** — WebSocket connection status
4. **Markets** — URL paste input, "Your Markets" (session list), Browse tabs (Trending, Crypto Live, Politics, Sports, Crypto, Finance, Culture, Geopolitics, Tech, Closing Soon)

## Track Sandbox (localhost:8888/sandbox)

A development tool for testing tracks without live market data:

- Track selection + Start/Stop (boots Sonic Pi in sandbox mode — no market data push)
- Manual sliders for all data values: heat, price, price_delta (-1 to +1), velocity, trade_rate, spread (0–1)
- Toggle buttons for tone (major/minor) and ambient mode
- One-shot event buttons: heat spike, price up, price down, resolved yes, resolved no
- **Track Analyzer**: Parses .rb file with regex, shows each `live_loop` and which `get(:param)` calls it reads. Visualizes the instrument-to-data mapping

## Browse Tabs

Each tab fetches 10 markets from the Gamma API filtered by `tag_id` (defined in `BROWSE_CATEGORIES` in config.py). Results are cached client-side per tab (except "Crypto Live" which always fetches fresh). "Trending" = all markets sorted by volume. "Closing Soon" = sorted by end_date ascending. "Crypto Live" = calls `fetch_live_finance_markets()` to find current rolling BTC/ETH windows. Clicking "Play" on a browse result fetches the market via `/api/play-url`, injects it into the DJ, and adds it to "Your Markets".

## Your Markets

A session-only list (JS array, not persisted) of markets the user has played. Clicking replays via `/api/pin`. Cleared with the "Clear" button.
