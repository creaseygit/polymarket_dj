# The Polymarket DJ — Claude Context

## What This Is

A DJ that turns Polymarket prediction market activity into generative music via Sonic Pi. Python scores markets by real-time heat, normalizes data to 0–1 ranges, applies a user-controlled **sensitivity curve**, and pushes adjusted values to Sonic Pi. Each track (.rb file) is a self-contained musical interpretation of the data — **no Python changes needed to add new tracks**.

**Repo:** https://github.com/creaseygit/polymarket_dj

## How to Run

```bash
cd C:\Github\polymarket_dj
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python server.py
# Open http://localhost:8888
# Click Start, pick a track
# Browse a category or paste a Polymarket URL to play a market
```

**Requirements:** VPN required (user is in UAE, Polymarket blocks non-US traffic). Sonic Pi must be installed at `C:\Program Files\Sonic Pi\`.

## Architecture

```
Polymarket APIs → Python (data layer) → Sonic Pi (music layer) → Audio Out
                       ↓
              Web Control Panel (localhost:8888)
                       ↓
              Track Sandbox (localhost:8888/sandbox)
```

### Data Flow

1. `polymarket/gamma.py` — REST client fetches markets by volume, category, slug, or live finance pattern
2. `polymarket/websocket.py` — WebSocket subscribes to asset IDs, receives price changes/trades/book updates
3. `polymarket/scorer.py` — `MarketScorer` computes heat score (0-1) from price velocity, trade rate, volume, spread
4. `mixer/mixer.py` — `AutonomousDJ` manages which market to play. Always selects the primary (Yes/Up) outcome via `_primary_asset()`. Auto-rotates live finance markets when they expire
5. `server.py` `param_push_loop` — Normalizes raw data to 0–1, applies sensitivity power curve (`4^(1-2s)`) to activity metrics + price delta, scales event thresholds, and pushes to Sonic Pi every 3s
6. `sonic_pi/headless.py` — Boots Sonic Pi daemon without GUI, sends code via OSC
7. Track `.rb` files — Self-contained musical interpretations that read raw data via `get()`
