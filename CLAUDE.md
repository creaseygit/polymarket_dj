# Data as Music — Claude Context

## What This Is

**Data as Music** (dam.fm) — *The Polymarket DJ*. A multi-user web app that turns prediction market activity into generative music via **Strudel** (browser-based audio, TidalCycles-inspired live coding patterns). Python scores markets by real-time heat, normalizes data to 0–1 ranges, applies a per-client **sensitivity curve**, and pushes adjusted values to each connected browser via WebSocket. Each track (`.js` file in `frontend/tracks/`) is a self-contained Strudel pattern that receives market data and generates music.

**Repo:** `creaseygit/data_as_music` on GitHub (public)
**License:** AGPL-3.0 (matching Strudel dependency)
**Domain:** dam.fm — Data as Music FM (CloudFlare DNS/CDN/HTTPS → Lightsail)

## How to Run

```bash
# macOS
source venv/bin/activate
python server.py

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python server.py

# Open http://localhost:8888
# Pick a market from browse tabs or paste a market URL
# Audio auto-starts on market selection (Play/Stop toggle in Audio panel)
```

**Local dev requirements:** VPN required (user is in UAE, prediction market APIs block non-US traffic).
**Deployed:** AWS Lightsail in us-east-1 (no VPN needed) + CloudFlare (DNS/CDN/HTTPS).

## Architecture

```
CloudFlare → Nginx → Python aiohttp (data only) ←→ Market APIs (Polymarket)
                          ↓ WebSocket (per client)
                     Browser (Strudel audio)
```

### Data Flow

1. `market/gamma.py` — REST client fetches markets by volume, category, slug, or live finance pattern
2. `market/websocket.py` — WebSocket subscribes to asset IDs, receives price changes/trades/book updates
3. `market/scorer.py` — `MarketScorer` computes heat score (0-1) from price velocity, trade rate, volume, spread
4. `mixer/mixer.py` — `AutonomousDJ` manages market list, live finance auto-rotation. Events dispatched via async callback (no OSC)
5. `server.py` `broadcast_loop` — Per-client: normalizes raw data to 0–1, applies sensitivity (power curve for activity metrics, window-length scaling for momentum/volatility), detects events with magnitudes, pushes JSON via WebSocket every 3s
6. `frontend/audio-engine.js` — Strudel bridge: init, track lifecycle, data→pattern routing. Two track modes: `evaluateCode(data)` runs raw strudel code via `evaluate()` (identical to strudel.cc REPL); `pattern(data)` returns a Pattern object directly
7. Track `.js` files — Self-contained Strudel tracks. Evaluate-mode tracks return strudel code strings; pattern-mode tracks return Pattern objects

| `market/scorer.py`        | Heat scoring: `price_velocity * 0.35 + trade_rate * 0.40 + volume * 0.15 + spread * 0.10`                           |

| `frontend/audio-engine.js`| Strudel init, track registry, pattern lifecycle (two modes: `evaluate` for raw strudel code, `pattern` for Pattern objects), music theory utils, track state getters (`getTrackRegistry()`, `getCurrentTrack()`, `getLatestData()`, `isPlaying()`) |
| `frontend/tracks/*.js`    | Track files (auto-discovered, dynamically loaded): `late_night_in_bb.js` (Late Night in Bb — 8-voice jazz trio with voice gain system), `poolside_house.js` (Poolside House — 7-voice relaxed house), `digging_in_the_markets.js` (Digging in the Markets — 8-voice lo-fi hip hop with swung drums and Rhodes), `signal_berlin.js` (Signal Berlin — 9-voice dark Berlin techno with acid bass filter sweeps driven by volatility), `oracle.js` (piano chords tracing price curve), `diagnostic.js` (one sound per signal for audible data verification), `_template.js` (annotated starter template for new tracks with voice/mastering support). Drop a new `.js` file here and restart the server — no other changes needed |
