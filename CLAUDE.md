# The Polymarket DJ — Claude Context

## What This Is

A multi-user web app that turns Polymarket prediction market activity into generative music via **Tone.js** (browser-based audio). Python scores markets by real-time heat, normalizes data to 0–1 ranges, applies a per-client **sensitivity curve**, and pushes adjusted values to each connected browser via WebSocket. Each track (`.js` file in `frontend/tracks/`) is a self-contained Tone.js musical interpretation of the data.

## How to Run

```bash
cd C:\Github\polymarket_dj
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python server.py
# Open http://localhost:8888
# Pick a market from browse tabs or paste a Polymarket URL
# Click Start to begin audio (runs in browser via Tone.js)
```

**Local dev requirements:** VPN required (user is in UAE, Polymarket blocks non-US traffic).
**Deployed:** AWS EC2 in us-east-1 (no VPN needed) + CloudFlare (DNS/CDN/HTTPS).

## Architecture

```
CloudFlare → Nginx → Python aiohttp (data only) ←→ Polymarket APIs
                          ↓ WebSocket (per client)
                     Browser (Tone.js audio)
```

### Data Flow

1. `polymarket/gamma.py` — REST client fetches markets by volume, category, slug, or live finance pattern
2. `polymarket/websocket.py` — WebSocket subscribes to asset IDs, receives price changes/trades/book updates
3. `polymarket/scorer.py` — `MarketScorer` computes heat score (0-1) from price velocity, trade rate, volume, spread
4. `mixer/mixer.py` — `AutonomousDJ` manages market list, live finance auto-rotation. Events dispatched via async callback (no OSC)
5. `server.py` `broadcast_loop` — Per-client: normalizes raw data to 0–1, applies sensitivity power curve (`4^(1-2s)`), detects events, pushes JSON via WebSocket every 3s
6. `frontend/audio-engine.js` — Tone.js bridge: init, track lifecycle, data→synth routing
7. Track `.js` files — Self-contained Tone.js tracks that receive data via `update(data)` method
